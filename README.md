# Weather App

This SwiftUI-based Weather app utilizes async/await, UserDefaults, Combine, and the openWeather API to provide users with up-to-date weather information. It leverages the Core Location framework for geolocation functionality and allows users to search for weather by city.

## Technologies

- **Async/Await:** Utilizes modern asynchronous programming with async/await for network calls.
- **Combine:**  Implements reactive programming paradigms with Combine for handling asynchronous events.
- **Core Location:** Utilizes the Core Location framework to access the user's geolocation.
- **UserDefaults:**  Stores user preferences and settings using UserDefaults.
- **API Integration:** Integrates with the openWeather API to fetch weather data.
- **City Search:** Implements a search functionality allowing users to look up weather by city name.
